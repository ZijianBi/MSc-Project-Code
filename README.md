# MSc-Project-Code
This is the programming code for Zijian Bi's MSc Project: A Comparison of the SHAP and LIME Explainability Tools for Machine Learning Models.

Note: Some plots in file:'Case_Study_one_SHAP&LIME' will not be shown. Because the interactive features of the notebook, such as custom JavaScript plots, will not work in the repository on GitHub. But the plot figures are displayed in the dissertation.
